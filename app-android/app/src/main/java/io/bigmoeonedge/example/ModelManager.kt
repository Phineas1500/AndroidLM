/**
 * Finds MoE gguf models on device. Models are read in place by the bmoe-cli subprocess (a gguf
 * can be tens of GB), so every source is a real filesystem directory the subprocess can open.
 *
 * Which directories are scanned depends on the distribution flavor (BuildConfig.SHARED_STORAGE):
 *
 *   always      the app-internal models dir (filesDir) — no permission needed, on a real
 *               filesystem where O_DIRECT works. The file picker (SAF import) lands models
 *               here. The app-specific external files dir is also scanned, so a model adb-pushed
 *               to /sdcard/Android/data/<applicationId>/files is found without any permission.
 *               (AndroidLM: upstream's in-app URL downloader was removed; this app has no
 *               INTERNET permission.)
 *   dev only    the public Downloads folder and /data/local/tmp/bmoe, for models adb-pushed
 *               to the device. These need all-files access, which only the dev flavor requests.
 *
 * Only MoE models are listed: this engine streams experts, so dense models are filtered out by
 * reading the gguf header (see [GgufHeader]).
